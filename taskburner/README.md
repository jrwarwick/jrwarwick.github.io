# TaskBurner: Super Simple Clientside-only Task Management

This is a client-side only html5 application for task management/productivity. Top to bottom, no special privileges are needed for "installation", it is composed of static, client-side files.

It probably sort-of half-way implements some pastiche of "productivity methods". Something like MSPoGSSCtC (Making Some Progress on Getting Some Stuff Closer to Completion). 


Appcache is needed to use page reliably offline; "to serve this [appcache] mime-type in Apache, add this line to your config file:

AddType text/cache-manifest .appcache
"
	from: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/appcache/beginner/

In Ubuntu 13 the file to edit was: /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/mime.conf  . /etc/mime.types already had the appropriate entry.
