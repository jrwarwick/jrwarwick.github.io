# Game Master Console

RL game facilitation tool. Including out-loud audible count down and more for games like LazerTag in a simple single-page html5 mini-app. For the non-commercial enjoyment of all. Originally envisioned for facilitating LAZER TAG (R)TM games. Probably good for NERF(R)TM too or squirtguns even.

All in html5 with thanks to jquery and html5 boilerplate. Tested and working on a first generation iPad and a jellybean Android smartphone.
